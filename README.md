Vim Helpify
===========

This plugin allows you to add vim help-doc style tags to any file, which are
automatically regenerated for you. Configuration is straightforward--simply set
`g:vim_helpify_files` to a list of the files you want tagged. vim will remember
these files and regenerate the tags when any of them are written.

The plugin also comes with syntax highlighting for vim script files, allowing
you to see the tags with the same coloring as the real vim help docs.
